stack almost works, 
pods come up., 
contrail comes up

I have a few minor errors to sort out, see the fiels 1,2,3 etc. 

I had to patch nodemgr to handle embedded containerd. 
that worke dbut the ui still lshows alarms. 

I needed contriall-status but thats failing to run on embedded containerd, I patched it but the python containerd library fails to see the pods.
I'm short on time now so will switch to rke1 and docker.

I'll seperate out the stacks and have one for rke2 one for rke1 so I can switch back if needed.
